# Monte-Carlo-method-for-photon-transport
Python implementation of Monte Carlo simulation of photon propagation in multilayered tissue based on books "Biomedical Optics" and "Optical Thermal Response Of Laser Irradiated Tissue". 
Simulation allows to use multiple layers, which physical properties are defined in .CSV file. Example of such configuration file is given in the repository. Simulation uses absorbtion, scattering, anisotropy and refractive coefficients to calculate behaviour of photon packets in the tissue. Simulation supports multiple types of beams, including pencil, flat-field and gaussian.
